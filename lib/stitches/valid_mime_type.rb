module Stitches
  # A middleware that requires all API calls to be for versioned JSON or Protobuf.
  #
  # This means that the Accept header (available to Rack apps as HTTP_ACCEPT) should be like so:
  #
  #     application/json; version=1
  #
  # This just checks that you've specified some numeric version.  ApiVersionConstraint should be used
  # to "lock down" the versions you accept.
  # 
  # Or in the case of a protobuf encoded payload the header should be like so:
  #
  #     application/protobuf
  #
  # There isn't an accepted standard for protobuf encoded payloads but this form is common.
